# Security Dashboard
A simple web server security dashboard written in PHP. Intended for use on a LAMP stack server.

## Setup instructions

1. Use a VPS or VM running the latest version of CentOS
2. After installing CentOS, use `su` to log in as root, then use `dnf update` to update your packages.
3. Make a Kali Linux VM so you can pentest the CentOS VM in a dev/testing environment before pushing to production
4. Write down the CentOS and Kali login info in a password manager
5. On the Kali VM, run `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade`

## Update

Project is on hold as I work on other things.
